## Possible simple way to automatically clean dirt sensors in vehicles

One way to save fuel in vehicles is to prevent carbonization of all pipes and internal combustion chambers.

One solution that could be done is to implement an injection nozzle after the vehicle's oxygen sensor, so that fuel dissolves the oil vapors that are stuck in the car's air intake pipe.

In cases of turbocharged gasoline engines, such a mechanism could be placed right after the first air sensor.

It is known that when the engine is turned off, the oil vaporizes and impregnates the vehicle's pipes, this measure above could minimize such an event.

Of course, the car's manager module would have to be reconfigured, the fuel injection system modified, in addition to performing new calculations to know the proper proportion of the air/fuel mixture.

By making this modification, it is expected that the carbonization of the vehicle's systems will gradually decrease. Maybe that way, we could have internal combustion engines with 51% efficiency along with other improvements.

I don't know if this could work for engines on the diesel cycle, but it might be interesting to test. Perhaps with the ammonia used in new vehicles this could be tried.
