Here is an assumption of a specific cargo port for containers with the largest capacity of ships berthed simultaneously.


Problems with this design will be the maneuverability of the natives and how much the wind will influence this task.


It is expected that with this design, the port can consume the smallest possible square meter per berthed ship, while maximizing the use of the entire port area.
