## Simple way to improve vehicle AC

Knowing the vehicle intake of the vehicle and its route.

Buy foam foam for air conditioner pipes according to the thickness located on your vehicle.

Insulate all this foam with aluminum tape so that the aluminum reflects infrared radiation.

Measure, cut and secure the foam to the tubing with heat-resistant nylon clips.

This process slightly increases the breathability of the vehicle air conditioner since these areas protected from the heat of the engine will be used to cool the interior space.

In order to know exactly the increase in efficiency of the air conditioner, you must do some calculations of thermal conductivity and heat loss.

For environments where the outside temperature of the car is above thirty degrees Celsius, this simple modification makes a significant difference.
