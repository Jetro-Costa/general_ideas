## IDEAS TO IMPROVE VEHICLES

We could discard all air intakes to cool the engine. The entire underside of the vehicle was to be insulated with sheet metal from front to end to improve aerodynamics.

The cooling pipes for both the engine, air conditioner, power steering, were positioned close to the wheels, taking advantage of the wind passing through them. These pipes could also be distributed on the bodywork of the vehicle to take advantage of its contact surface in order to provide cooling. The cooling fan would remain in its traditional position.

Wheel caps or other more aerodynamic shape.

Such measures above would allow exploring new waysThe aerodynamics of all means of transport should be better explored both passive and active.

An engine using Otto cycle or diesel engine. Minimize friction between engine parts as much as possible.

If you wanted, you could leave only a single opening for air inlet to the engine or do it in the engine compartment, as is already done.

Carrying out a spongy insulation, with an aluminum coating, of all the cold piping of the air conditioner, by doing so, the cooling power of the air conditioner would be increased.

Place an automatic transmission so that the largest efficiency area of the engine is used, after analyzing the torque and horsepower graph of the engine used in the vehicle.

All these changes could be simulated in software, which I am unable to do. However, by simple logic, I believe that this could increase the overall efficiency of the internal combustion vehicle, both car and truck or bus, reducing the transport costs of these categories.

There is the issue of market demand, few people and companies think about the final consumption of fuels since they are cheap and their personal income is high; however, if you calculate this cost over the entire useful life of the vehicle, there is an opening for a huge cost reduction. Unfortunately the auto industry doesn't currently provide us with that option.

Perhaps those who aim to resolve this gap in the market are car customization companies.

At the moment; Electric vehicles are still inefficient. Perhaps industrial vehicles; how dump trucks used in mining companies that use generators and electric motors are more efficient (I still don't know).

Maybe they are; since there is no use of transmission and other components with high mechanical friction content. Anyway. It would use an engine optimized to be a generator; a good electric generator; etc; etc.

A good example of what I'm talking about is the Toyota Prius and some BMW electric vehicles that have an internal combustion generator attached.

Options for wasted gases in internal combustion engines should be explored, methods to recover this pressurized energy to generate electrical energy should be used.
