### Maximization of agricultural production

One way to do this is through vertical farms, such a production model maximizes the use of square meters.

This method is already being widely explored by some companies, it allows the production of high quality food in a controlled environment.

One way to accomplish this is by implementing the agricultural shed next to a thermoelectric plant; took advantage of CO2 gases to manage them in the plants, thus maximizing production.

In any case, this method will only be adopted if it is economically viable.
